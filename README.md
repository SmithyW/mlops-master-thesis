## Getting started

_This getting started guide is written for Linux systems. During development, an Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 12.6 were used.
MacOS is not tested but should also work._

`python -m venv <virtual environment>`

Enter the virtual environment

`source <virtual environment>/bin/activate`

Install all required python packages using
